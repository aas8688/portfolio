                    <p>Walking past the J-wing by the gym, University of Ontario Institute of Technology and Durham College students will be able to see the art piece known as ‘Diversity.’ Dawn MacNutt, an artist from Nova Scotia, created the six-foot-tall, bronze sculpture in 2008.</p>
                    <p>MacNutt enjoys creating pieces that are human-like form and creates most of her pieces using natural materials. She uses an art form called sculptural weaving to create her pieces. Similar to basket weaving, the art form uses the artist’s choice of materials and weaving techniques to create a sculpture. MacNutt usually uses willow to create her pieces, which is also a favourite of basket weavers. Once she finishes a piece, it is sent for casting, which will destroy the original art, but leave behind a bronze rendition, such as the piece that can be found on campus.
                    </p>
                    <p>Her great-great-great grandfather built her studio in Nova Scotia, where she was born and lives there in 1838. MacNutt has been an artist for over 50 years. She got her Bachelors in Art in 1957 from Mount Allison University. Over the years MacNutt has been inducted into the Royal Canadian Academy of the Arts in 2008. She is a member of the International Sculpture Centre, Nova Scotia Designer Craftsman and Visual Arts Nova Scotia. On top of those accomplishments, MacNutt also served as national director on Canadian Craft Council for four years from 1983-1987. MacNutt has led seminars and workshops all throughout North America. Her career has been highlighted in articles, reviews and even a filmed documentary. She also has her work featured in Canada and the United States.
