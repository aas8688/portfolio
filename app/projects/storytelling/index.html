                <h1>Campus Artwork Map</h1>
                <p>Artwork is everywhere. As you walk through the Durham College (DC) and University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT)  north Oshawa campus, chances are you’ve come across one of the pieces without even knowing it. The giant “O” by
                    the bus loop has become an iconic landmark for the campus, but it’s also just one of 12 pieces of artwork displayed around the campus. Most of these pieces aren’t as prominent as the giant “O” and you’re likely to miss them if you
                    aren’t paying attention, but each piece is rich with community history and they all have a story to tell.  Some of these pieces have found themselves traveling across the country, from the east to west coast, finally finding a home
                    at DC and UOIT. Here, you will find the various stories and culture these pieces have brought to the campus. </p>

                    <p>As the continuous flow of buses fills the bus loop at Durham College’s (DC) and UOIT campus, it’s hard to miss the shiny steel circle, which greets students each day. Because the sculpture is at the hub of the campus, it’s of little
                        wonder that the structure has become a symbol of DC and UOIT. Commonly known as the ‘Big O,’ the sculpture has become a landmark for several generations of students, but the artist of the piece, Edward Falkenberg, knows it by another
                        name: Connect.</p>

                        by Zheng, Yi Bo in 2008, the bust was donated to the campus by Shu, Xin, chairman, Canadian Chinese General Chamber of Industry and Commerce in 2011.</p>

                        by Quebec artist André Fournelle, the piece called Gate to the Future serves as a focal point for the campus and the ‘harmonious relationship between art and technology, form and function’, according to the university.</p>

                    <p>Nestled in the corner between Durham College (DC) and the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) at the north Oshawa campus, Garland sits in silent beauty with a spiraling motion that gives the appearance of upward movement.
                        For Saskatchewan-based artist, Douglas Bentham, this was the intention and to him, Garland represents and embraces movement within the context of time and space. “In abstract terms, I attempt to coalesce this movement into a singular
                        gesture,” says Bentham. “Here it is manifested through a series of cursive planes and lines that are ground gathering, then visually lifting upward toward an uncertain destination.”</p>

                        in boldness, it certainly makes up for in beauty. Toronto-based artist and musician, Sam Ferrara based the design around the theme of a butterfly, symbolizing that if a student wants to achieve something, they can because everything
                        beyond is considered within reach.</p>

                        autumn. That’s at least one of the visions that former faculty member Darlene Bolahood had when she first came up with the inspiration for her artwork.</p>

                    <p>The giant moose greeting students as they walk into the Durham College and University of Ontario Institute of Technology’s Computer Commons, located in the Gordon Willey Building has become a recognizable symbol within the institutions.
                        It has become a piece of campus culture and a point of direction for new students. For Toronto-based artist Charles Pachter, the Computer Commons’ moose – along with the moose as an animal has been a lifelong inspiration and has
                        been integral to Pachter’s success as an artist.</p>

                        the waves of energy and the power of man by the crafted wire along the horse. True Power was a source of art to display the harnessing of energy and what better way to display such a remarkable piece than locating it inside a building
                        that’s sole purpose is to find renewable energy sources.</p>

                        Their attitude would be characterized as both positive and thoughtful. The placement of the works imply the kind of relationships and interactions students and faculty have when acknowledging one another as they travel across campus.
                        The nature of the bronze work, derived from woven willow, creates an illusion of implied movement to passers as light plays through the back and front.
